## Getting Started
Inside the `data_files` folder you'll find two zip files once unzipped, you'll find a few different data files. These are the real events coming from our Series Events API, these are stored as JSONL files.

We have also included a simple node script that will allow you to connect via a websocket and consume the events files.

You can find additional event documentation and terminology [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FPkcvrgtKSyPmnxSWM4xITzaxDMHikz3PHOQLxvoJao/edit?usp=sharing).

### GIT LFS
We use git LFS to store the files you should install this from the [git lfs website](https://git-lfs.com/), and then run `git lfs fetch --all` to get the files from LFS. You'll then need to unarchive the ZIP files to be able to run the test server. 

### Test Server
Included is a test server, this is written in node and will allow you to connect to a websocket connection 

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Once the server is running you can connect via the following URL `ws://localhost:8080/{series_ID}` replacing the `{SERIES_ID}` with one listed above.
